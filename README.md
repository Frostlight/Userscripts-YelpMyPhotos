# Userscripts-YelpMyPhotos
A lightweight userscript that augments Yelp business photo pages (/biz_photos/*) with a “My Photos” button next to the native “Add Photos” control. When clicked, it automatically appends your Yelp user ID as a userid= query parameter to the current biz_photos URL, taking you directly to photos you’ve submitted for that business.​
